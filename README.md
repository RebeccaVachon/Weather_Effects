# ðŸŒ¤ How Does the Weather Effect my Activity? â›ˆ
## Description
This project compares my fitbit activity data to data from a local weather station for 2022. 

## Set up
Clone repository, and install Anaconda 
Create virtual environment <code> conda create â€“prefix ./env </code>
Activate virtual enviroment <code> conda activate env </code>
Use conda to install packages

Activate virtual environment
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install requirements.txt pip install -r requirements.txt
Type jupyter notebook to start Jupyter Notebook, and select lunacy.ipynb to run.

## Features
1. I will read in two data files.
2. I will clean my data and perform a pandas merge with the two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.
3. I will make a Tableau dashboard to display my data.
4. I will Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.
5. I will use annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md.
